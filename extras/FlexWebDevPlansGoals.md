## Graduation Requirements
In order to graduate, we require that your program manager signs off on your portfolio, including every capstone project you complete. Your program manager (PM) must approve each step in the process outlined in this section.

When building a capstone, you’ll submit the following:

1. Proposal: propose a unique, useful project idea
- Each capstone should solve a specific problem or provide a specific service. You’ll answer questions about your users, the technology you plan to use, and your execution strategy.
2. Design: wireframe and design your app
- Once your capstone project idea has been approved, submit an HTML mockup of your design. This stage is a sketch, but it should include all UI elements that you’re considering using, and it should show the overall look and feel that you will represent with your final design.
3. Implementation: build your project
- Bring your plans to life! Follow the technical requirements for building and hosting your project.

Feel free to continue working as you wait for feedback on each step.
