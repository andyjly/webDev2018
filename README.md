# Web Development again from scratch!
Back to web development again.

I made a new Github to keep my studies notes and things located in one spot and my more established well known github to host my projects instead. Keeps the clutter cleaner.

** NOTE Developers are problem solvers, not just coders **

## HTML
- take the HTML Quiz from w3school here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp
    - got an 82%, made some careless mistakes, but it helps to review what you don't know/remember

## CSS
- sample of a site with some neat css: https://www.supremo.tv/typeterms/ 
- Here's a site if you have CSS questions: https://css-tricks.com/

- Search if has browser support at: https://caniuse.com/
- Transitions and transform is pretty fun: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/transitions-and-transforms
	- the example they use uses scss so you'll have to convert to css

## Javascript
- DOM: Document Object Model, something browser creates to allow us mod page
	- can change all HTML elements, HTML attributes, and CSS in the page
	- remove existing HTML elements and attributes
	- add new HTML elements and attributes
	- Can react to all existing HTML events in the page
	- can create new HTML events in the page
- Check up Eloquent JavaScript if you want to learn more!

- **NOTE TO SELF**: ADD SEMICOLONS AT THE END, good habit even if JS has Automatic Semicolon insertion
	- better safe than sorry!
- Here are some JS events: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
