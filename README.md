# Web Development again from scratch!
Back to web development again.

I made a new Github to keep my studies notes and things located in one spot and my more established well known github to host my projects instead. Keeps the clutter cleaner.

## HTML
- take the HTML Quiz from w3school here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp
    - got an 82%, made some careless mistakes, but it helps to review what you don't know/remember

## CSS
- sample of a site with some neat css: https://www.supremo.tv/typeterms/

- Browser Support: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_browsersupport.asp
	- show's which browsers can support
	- things like -moz-, -webkit- means not fully implemented on all sites, so need to include prefixes to make sure it works
