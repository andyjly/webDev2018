# Web Development again from scratch!
Back to web development again.

I made a new Github to keep my studies notes and things located in one spot and my more established well known github to host my projects instead. Keeps the clutter cleaner.

## HTML
- take the HTML Quiz from w3school here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp
    - got an 82%, made some careless mistakes, but it helps to review what you don't know/remember

## CSS
- sample of a site with some neat css: https://www.supremo.tv/typeterms/ 
- Here's a site if you have CSS questions: https://css-tricks.com/
	- almanac is useful to see a bunch of css properties
- CSS Zen Garden has a lot of examples: http://www.csszengarden.com/
- Specificity Calculator: https://specificity.keegan.st/
	- useful if you want to see which selectors takes precedence


## Extras
- free hd pictures you can download: https://unsplash.com/

- Fonts can be found at Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/

## Color Pickers
- **NOTE** Picking the right colors so that humans can actually see the content is important!
- A useful color picker site that also show complementary colors: http://paletton.com/
